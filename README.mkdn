LiquidSmooth Source
===================
To get started with LiquidSmooth, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

Create the Directories
----------------------

You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.

To create them run:

    mkdir -p ~/bin
    mkdir -p ~/liquid

Install the Repository
----------------------

Enter the following to download the "repo" binary:

    curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo

    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

You may need to reboot for these changes to take effect. 
Now enter the following to initialize the repository:

    cd ~/liquid

Repositories:
---------------

Before you continue --> run this in the terminal

    repo init -u git://github.com/LiquidSmooth/android.git -b jb2-armv6

    repo sync

Sync Kernel Source
----------------------

In this repo inside kernel folder are pre made manifests grouped together

To create kernel manifest:

    cd .repo

    mkdir local_manifests

    example: copy sgs3_manifest.xml .repo/local_manifests

    repo sync

Building the System
---------------

Initialize the environment with the envsetup.sh script. Note that replacing "source" with a single dot saves a few characters, and the short form is more commonly used in documentation.

    . build/envsetup.sh

    lunch

Enter the number of the build you want to start and press enter

Build the Code:

    time mka liquid


Building the System via Buildscript for Nightly 
---------------

Put the script in ~/liquid

And Run this CMD

    . build_liquid.sh "device"

    example: . build_liquid.sh m7
