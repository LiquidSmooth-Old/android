LiquidSmooth Source
===================
To get started with LiquidSmooth, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

Create the Directories
----------------------

You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.

To create them run:

    mkdir -p ~/bin
    mkdir -p ~/liquid

Install the Repository
----------------------

Enter the following to download the "repo" binary:

    curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo

    chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

You may need to reboot for these changes to take effect. 
Now enter the following to initialize the repository:

    cd ~/liquid

Repositories:

Before you continue --> run this in the terminal

    repo init -u git://github.com/pixelfreak2005/liquid_platform_manifest.git -b kitkat
